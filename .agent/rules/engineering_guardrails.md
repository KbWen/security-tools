# Engineering Guardrails (Constitution)

## Scope

Global (applies to all projects using template).

## Reading Mode

- **Full Mode** (default for `feature`, `architecture-change`, `hotfix`): Read this entire document.
- **Quick Mode** (for `quick-win`): Do NOT read this file. Essential quick-win rules (Confidence Gate, Bug Fix Protocol, Doc Integrity) are embedded in `bootstrap.md` §7 quick-win classification. If the task escalates beyond quick-win, switch to Full Mode.
- **Skip Mode** (for `tiny-fix` ONLY): Do NOT read this file. `AGENTS.md` §Core Directives provides sufficient governance for tiny-fix tasks (scope discipline, evidence requirement, fast-path rules). If the task escalates beyond tiny-fix, switch to Quick or Full Mode and read this file at that point.

## Role

Non-negotiable principles for agent-driven development.

## 1. Core Philosophy

### 1.1 Correctness First

- Correctness > Performance/Complexity/Features.
- Unverifiable behavior is classified as UNSAFE.

### 1.2 Explicit Over Implicit

- Assumptions, preconditions, limitations MUST be explicitly stated.
- Implicit magic behavior is PROHIBITED.
- Persistence-layer ↔ domain-model conversions MUST use explicit named methods (e.g., `fromRecord()`, `toRecord()`). Implicit casting or field-by-field spread at call sites is PROHIBITED.

### 1.3 Reproducibility by Default

- Same input MUST yield same output.
- Randomness MUST be controllable, toggleable, and traceable.

## 2. Change Safety Principles

### 2.1 Small & Reversible Changes

- Micro-patches preferred.
- Rollback MUST be designed upfront.

### 2.2 Preserve Existing Behavior

- DO NOT alter existing semantics unless explicitly requested.
- New behavior MUST be feature-flagged or config-driven.

## 3. Data & Time Integrity

- Look-ahead bias PROHIBITED.
- Exact temporal ordering MUST be stated.
- Input -> Output causality MUST be clear.

## 4. Design Before Implementation

- BEFORE coding, MUST provide: Problem understanding, Design, Trade-offs, Risks.
- If ambiguous, priority is CLARIFICATION.

### 4.1 Confidence Gate (Auto-Enforced)

Before executing any implementation step, AI MUST internally assess and state:

- `Confidence: [0-100]%` with a 1-line rationale.
- **< 80%**: STOP. Surface the uncertainty and ask a clarifying question. DO NOT proceed.
- **80–90%**: State the assumption explicitly, then proceed with caution.
- **> 90%**: Proceed normally.

This check is silent when confidence is high — no extra output needed above 90%. Only surfaces when it matters.

### 4.2 Spec Freezing (SSoT Protection)

- Whenever a Spec is approved or the task transitions to implementation, the Spec MUST be marked as **FROZEN** (e.g., via YAML frontmatter `status: frozen`).
- AI agents MUST NOT modify, review, or suggest refactoring for any document marked as `FROZEN` or `Finalized` during normal tasks.
- **Exception (AI-Initiated Unfreeze)**: If the AI discovers that a FROZEN spec must be changed (due to a bug or requirement change), the AI MUST:
  1. **STOP** and surface the issue explicitly: "⚠️ [Filename] is FROZEN but requires update: [Reason]. Approve to unfreeze and continue? (yes/no)"
  2. Only proceed after user responds **YES**.
  3. Set status to `draft`, make changes, then re-freeze during `/ship`.

### 4.3 Pre-Implementation Checklist

Before writing any code, AI MUST complete ALL steps in order and record each in the Work Log:

1. **Read project governance docs** — confirm active AGENTS.md directives and project-specific rules file.
2. **Read relevant existing code** — prevent duplicate implementations; understand current patterns before introducing new ones.

Skipping any step = **Bootstrap Gate FAIL**.

## 5. Testing & Verification

- Logic Change -> Add Test.
- Interface Change -> Verify Compatibility.
- **Sanity Check**: Is output bounding safe? Side-effects?
- **Doc-First Pillar**: Architecture/Core logic changes MUST precede with Spec/ADR in `docs/`.
- **Naming/Locations**:
  - ADRs: `docs/adr/ADR-[ID]-[kebab-case].md`
  - Specs: `docs/specs/[feature-name].md`
  - Guides: `docs/guides/[topic].md`
  - Agent Work Logs: `.agentcortex/context/work/`
- **Write Path Guard**: Agents MUST NOT write project specs to `.agentcortex/specs/` or project ADRs to `.agentcortex/adr/`. Those directories contain framework-owned template fixtures only. All project artifacts MUST go to `docs/specs/` and `docs/adr/`. If the SSoT Spec Index references `.agentcortex/specs/`, READ from it but WRITE new work to `docs/specs/`.
  - Private Context: `.agentcortex/context/private/` (local-only, gitignored)
    - USE FOR: personal dev environment configs, private remote URLs, internal credentials references, team-specific workflows not intended for public repos.
    - DO NOT USE FOR: project architecture docs, contribution guides, public development standards.
    - WHEN UNCERTAIN: Agent MUST present options to user in `/plan` phase. Autonomous path decisions on ambiguous content are PROHIBITED.

### 5.1 Service & Provider Test Coverage

- Every new Service class or Provider MUST have ≥ 1 unit test before Ship. No test = **Ship Gate FAIL**.
- Test count regression (fewer passing tests than the last committed baseline) MUST have written justification in the Work Log. Undocumented regression = **Ship Gate FAIL**.

### 5.2 Error Surface Rules

- Service/Provider layer errors MUST `return null` or a sealed error type. Unhandled exceptions that escape a Service or Provider boundary = **Gate FAIL**.
- Every `catch` block MUST include at minimum a log statement. Silent `catch {}` with no logging = **Review Gate FAIL**.

### 5.3 Spec Drift Prevention & Test Quality

**Spec Drift Prevention**
- Before implementing any feature, the agent MUST read the corresponding Spec file in `docs/specs/`. Missing spec for a non-trivial feature = **Bootstrap Gate FAIL**.
- If implementation deviates from the spec (even slightly), STOP and report the deviation before proceeding. Silent scope expansion or shrinkage = **Gate FAIL**.
- Never silently expand or shrink scope — surface every delta to the user and obtain confirmation before continuing.

**Test Quality**
- Unit tests MUST cover: happy path, error path, and at least one boundary condition. A test asserting only `expect(result, isNotNull)` is insufficient — test actual values.
- For date-based, time-based, or numerical-boundary logic: always include edge cases (zero values, first/last day of period, maximum boundary).
- Tests MUST verify behaviour, not implementation. Mirroring the implementation formula in an assertion without validating the business rule is insufficient.

### 5.4 YAGNI — You Aren't Gonna Need It

- Do not introduce abstract base classes, mixins, or utility layers unless there are 3+ concrete use cases already in the codebase.
- Single-file implementation first; refactor to a shared abstraction only when the second real consumer exists.
- Adding a new dependency requires justification in the PR or Work Log: explain why existing code cannot solve the problem.

## 6. Explainability & Traceability

- Big decisions MUST be traceable ("Why was this done?").
- Intermediate results and Decision Traces prioritized.

## 7. Scope Discipline

> See also: `AGENTS.md` §Core Directives ("UNAUTHORIZED REFACTORING STRICTLY PROHIBITED").

- ONLY solve requested issue. If larger issue discovered, output a "Follow-up Issue" recommendation.

## 8. Agent Operating Mode

- **Default**: Conservative, Explainable, Stable.
- **When Uncertain**: State ambiguity, provide 2-3 options, DEFER high-impact decisions to user.

### 8.1 Bug Fix Protocol

**MFR (Minimal Reproducible Failure)**: BEFORE any fix, MUST provide:

- Repro steps (≤3 steps), Expected vs. Actual behavior.

**2-Strike ESC**: If the SAME issue fails after 2 patches:

1. STOP patching immediately.
2. Output diagnostic: modified code blocks, call relationships, behavior diffs ONLY. ❌ No narrative claims.
3. Record failure in Work Log and DEFER to user for escalation.

**Active Tracking**: After each failed patch attempt, AI MUST append to Work Log: `Patch Attempt [N]: [1-line result]`. When N ≥ 2, the 2-Strike ESC is automatically triggered.

**Async/Data-Flow Safety**: When modifying async or data-flow code, MUST verify: error handling, race condition guards, and loading state management.

### 8.2 External Tool Delegation Protocol

External CLI tools (e.g., `ask-openrouter`, `codex`) are **OPTIONAL accelerators**. Projects MAY operate without any of them.

**Pre/Post-Flight (Mandatory for all external tool invocations)**:

- **Pre-Flight** (in order — fail fast):
  1. **Cost-Tier Confirmation** (memory-only): low-cost → auto-execute; high-cost (quality/max profile) → confirm with user first.
  2. Update Work Log with `Executor: <tool-name>` (only if cost-tier passes).
  3. **Availability Check (Silent)**: run health check (e.g., `python -m ask_openrouter --help`, `codex --version`). If unavailable: **silently fall back** to AI-native execution. DO NOT warn user. DO NOT suggest installation. Cache per session.
- **Post-Flight**: Read tool output, verify scope alignment, update Work Log, apply Gate Check per §10.2.
- External tool output is treated as **Junior Tool output** — AI MUST review before accepting.

## 9. Intent Safety Rules

User input in any form (natural language, keywords, or slash commands) triggers the same workflow gates. AI determines the current phase and enforces prerequisites automatically. Slash commands are optional shortcuts, not required triggers.

### 9.1 Acknowledgment-only Inputs (No Action)

The following inputs MUST NOT trigger any state transition or execution:

- EN: "OK", "Sure", "Got it", "Alright", "Fine"
- ZH: "好", "收到", "嗯", "了解", "沒問題"

Correct behavior: Confirm receipt, optionally ask what the next step should be.

### 9.2 Vague Inputs (Must Clarify)

Inputs without a clear action verb or direction MUST prompt a clarification question:

- EN: "fix it", "tweak something", "make it better", "adjust this"
- ZH: "弄一下", "調整一下", "改改看", "處理一下"

NEVER guess intent. NEVER proceed on vague input.

### 9.3 Search Policy (Lexical-first)

When locating code, files, or definitions:

1. ALWAYS use lexical search first (ripgrep, path lookup, directory listing).
2. Semantic search is allowed ONLY after lexical search yields no results.
3. If still unresolved, ask a targeted question.

### 9.4 Namespace Isolation (Downstream Safety)

AgentCortex deploys workflows and skills into downstream projects. Those projects may have their own custom commands, skills, or automation — including inside `.agent/` directories. The Intent Router must respect boundaries:

1. **Framework-managed vs user-owned**: The distinction is NOT by directory. Files listed in `.agentcortex-manifest` are framework-managed. Everything else — even files inside `.agent/workflows/` or `.agent/skills/` — belongs to the project owner. Users are free to add their own workflows and skills alongside AgentCortex's.
2. **Collision resolution**: If a user-created command name collides with an AgentCortex workflow (e.g., both have a `/deploy`), the **user's command takes priority**. AgentCortex workflows are infrastructure; user commands are application-level.
3. **Natural language routing**: When AI receives natural language that could map to either an AgentCortex phase or a user-defined command, AI MUST check: "Is the user talking about the AgentCortex governance process, or about their project-specific action?" If ambiguous, ask.
4. **Governance still applies**: User-defined workflows and skills are not exempt from AgentCortex governance. Phase order, gates, and evidence requirements still apply — but the user's custom logic drives the implementation, not AgentCortex's.

### 9.5 Core Principle
>
> When intent is unclear, ASK. Never guess. Never proceed.

## 10. vNext Governance & Classification

### 10.1 Escalation Rules

| Trigger Condition | Minimum Classification |
| --- | --- |
| < 3 files, no semantic change | `tiny-fix` |
| 1-2 modules, clear scope, no cross-module impact | `quick-win` |
| Touches `exports` / public API / signature | `feature` |
| Touches >1 module import graph | `feature` |
| Adds new directories | `feature` |
| Alters data-flow / system boundaries | `architecture-change` |
| Alters default configs impacting users | `feature` |

### 10.2 Gate Type & Evidence Standards

| Category | Mandatory Gates | Min Evidence Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **tiny-fix** | classify → plan (inline) → execute | diff summary + 1-line verification |
| **quick-win** | classify → check Spec Index → plan → execute → evidence | diff + before/after behavior statement |
| **feature** | bootstrap → spec → plan → review → test → handoff | test output + verifiable demo steps |
| **architecture-change** | bootstrap → ADR → spec → plan → migration/rollback → handoff | migration plan + rollback verification |
| **hotfix** | systematic debug → evidence → fix → retro → handoff | root cause + fix verification + retro |

AI self-enforces the phase order above. Users may invoke phases via slash commands (as shortcuts) or natural language.

### 10.3 Tiny-Fix Fast-Path

- **Definition**: Modifies < 3 files WITHOUT semantic change (typo, docs, non-functional config).
- **Flow**: `classify → one-line scope → execute → inline evidence → done`.
- **Exclusion**: Bypasses full bootstrap, handoff, and Work Log overhead.

### 10.4 Quick-Win Fast-Path

- **Definition**: Clear, contained change to 1-2 modules with a well-defined outcome. Semantic change IS present, but cross-module impact is LOW.
- **Flow**: `classify → check Spec Index for existing coverage → plan (brief) → execute → update existing Spec if found → inline evidence → done`.
- **Exclusion**: No formal Spec required. No `/handoff` required. Work Log entry optional but recommended.
- **Doc Integrity (MANDATORY)**: While No *new* Spec is required, if an **existing** Spec already covers the target area, the AI MUST update that Spec to prevent "Documentation Decay." If the change is too complex for a stealth update, use the "Spec Seed" mechanism in `/retro` to flag it for formalization.
- **Examples**: Changing an API response format, adding a config flag, fixing a single-module bug with known root cause.

### 10.5 Handoff/Ship Hard Gate

> See also: `AGENTS.md` §Delivery Gates.

- The ship phase MUST verify handoff references in single-line format: `ship:[doc=<path>][code=<path>][log=<path>]`
- If any field is missing, AI MUST reject shipping and list the missing field(s).

### 10.6 Completion Guard (Anti-Silent-Exit)

When AI detects a task is nearing completion (e.g., user says "done", "完成了", "差不多了", or AI has finished all planned steps), AI MUST self-check BEFORE responding:

1. Is the task classified as `quick-win` or higher?
2. Has the handoff phase been executed? (Check: does Work Log have a `## Resume` block?)
3. Has the retro phase been executed? (Check: does Work Log have a `## Lessons` block?)

**For `feature` / `architecture-change`**: If handoff or retro is missing, AI MUST remind: "📋 Before closing: handoff and retro haven't run yet. Want me to proceed with them now?"

**For `quick-win`**: AI SHOULD ask: "Quick task done. Run a brief retro to capture lessons? (yes/skip)"

**For `tiny-fix`**: Skip entirely.

## 11. Multi-Person Collaboration Rules

> Canonical rules are in `AGENTS.md` §Multi-Person Collaboration and §Multi-Session Concurrency. This section adds implementation details.

- **Work Log Naming**: `.agentcortex/context/work/<worklog-key>.md` for single-person, `.agentcortex/context/work/<owner>-<worklog-key>.md` for multi-person.
- Missing active Work Logs are recoverable during bootstrap/plan/handoff: resolve `<worklog-key>`, create or recover the active log.

### 11.1 Ship Guard (SSoT Merge Protection)

Before `/ship` writes to `current_state.md`:

1. AI MUST check if `current_state.md` has been modified since the task started (compare timestamps or last-known content hash).
2. If modified by another person/session: AI MUST warn and require confirmation before merge.
3. If proceeding, AI MUST perform an **additive merge** (append new entries without removing existing ones), NOT a full overwrite.
